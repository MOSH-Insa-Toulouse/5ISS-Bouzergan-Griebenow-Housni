Our project revolves around the integration of a gas sensor, developed during a training period at AIME. Aligned with the objectives of the Innovative Smart Systems major, we undertook the entire processâ€”from conception and creation in the AIME laboratory to schematic design, routing, wiring, programming, and addressing wireless communication and network aspects.
